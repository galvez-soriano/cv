## **Working Papers**

**Impact of English Instruction on Labor Market Outcomes: The case of Mexico** (<a href="https://galvez-soriano.github.io/home/Papers/EnglishInstructionMex.pdf">PDF</a>)  <br />
**Job Market Paper** 

In this paper I measure the effect of exposure to a foreign language in school on student achievement and labor market outcomes. I exploit a policy change in Mexico that introduced English instruction in elementary schools through the National English Program in Basic Education (NEPBE) in 2009. I construct a novel database, which contains nation-wide information of elementary school students linked to school panel data on characteristics like hours of English instruction as well as to their labor market records in adulthood. Using a Two-Way Fixed Effects (TWFE) model, I find that exposure to English instruction reduces the likelihood that an individual participates in formal sector employment. It is likely that this result is due to exposure affecting enrollment in high school and college, as my analysis focuses on young adults aged 16-24. Focusing on a sub-sample that is unlikely to be enrolled by age 16, I find that the exposure to English instruction has no effect on wages. However, I do find a positive effect among high achieving individuals. On the other hand, exposure reduced men's mobility, but increased women's. This could be explained by women substituting jobs in agriculture for manufacturing industries. Furthermore, within manufacturing, I find a strong substitution of low-English intensive jobs for high-English intensive ones. I also evaluate the effect of exposure to English instruction on students’ achievement to determine if part of the effect on wages is due to a reallocation of resources towards English instruction in primary schools, which can potentially affect the formation of human capital. I find no effects on Language and Math test scores, which suggests that the estimated effect of exposure to English language on wages is not reflecting changes to general cognitive skills.

**English skills and labor market outcomes in Mexico** (<a href="https://galvez-soriano.github.io/home/Papers/English_skills_in_Mexico.pdf"> PDF</a>)

In this paper I study the prevalence of English skills and the labor market returns to English skills in Mexico. I use individual-level data from the 2014 Subjective Well-being Survey, which unlike other large nationally representative data sets includes a measure of English proficiency, to describe English-speaking ability in Mexico and to estimate the effect of English skills on labor market earnings. To address the concern that English skills may be endogenous in this relationship, I take advantage of policy changes in several Mexican states that introduced English instruction (as a subject) in public elementary schools in the 1990s. Using a difference-in-differences (DD) strategy, I estimate the effect of these state policies introducing English instruction; this study is the first to evaluate these policies. I then use the variation in English skills arising from these policy changes to estimate the causal effect of English skills on labor market outcomes. First, I find that English-speaking ability is not common among Mexicans in Mexico, with only 3\% of adults age 18-65 reporting they speak English. Second, the state policies introducing English instruction in elementary schools increased the likelihood of speaking English, increased wages and shifted workers out of more physically-demanding occupations. I do not find evidence of differential trends between the policy-adopting states and never-adopting comparison states, which provides support for the parallel trend assumption needed to interpret these DD estimates as the causal effects of the state policies. Instrumental variables estimates of the effect of speaking English on earnings using the state policies introducing English instruction as instruments for the English skills variable suggest positive effects of speaking English on earnings; however, these estimates are imprecise and not significant at conventional levels of significance.

**Can Social Pensions Reduce Poverty? Evidence from Mexico** (<a href="https://galvez-soriano.github.io/home/Papers/Pensions_Galvez-Soriano.pdf"> PDF</a>) with David Escamilla  and Clemente Avila. _Revisions requested at Economic Inquiry_

This paper examines the impact of social pensions on old-age poverty in Mexico. To achieve causal identification, we leverage the expansion of Mexico's flagship, non-means-tested social pension program in 2013. We find that the program's expansion significantly reduced extreme poverty, mainly among indigenous seniors and in rural areas. However, the expansion had negligible effects in urban contexts and on other well-being dimensions, including labor force participation and health outcomes. This suggests that social pensions were not effective in simultaneously ensuring minimum economic well-being and inducing retirement. The program's mistargeting and small cash transfer are among the main explanations.
